With the purpose of add some biology to Mindustry, Animalia is a mod that contains unique _biological forms, blocks, machines and mechanics_ to discover the world of the Animalia Kingdom!

The animals are made to be cute and useful, giving the game a new vibe.

Frogs are the only animals for now, but only for now. More animals are being created.
